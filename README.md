According to the SMS that I received from the company, I thought the deadline of this project is gonna be until Friday,
so I was doing my other jobs, and just checked the academy website and realized that I only have 1 day for this project.
I didn't have much time, but managed to do some stuff on this project as below:

app is connected to the api, pagination works fine.
animations and add user implemented, too.

responsiveness is not bad, didn't have much time to work on that, too, but maybe I could manage to fix that later on future projects (?)

the part for posting new users is implemented, but the website reqres.in isn't really optimized, maybe you don't get what you want on the UI,
you can check the code though. (post request is implemented, no worries.)

libraries being used:
NextJS
TailwindCSS
FramerMotion
Axios

Thanks for your attention,
Taha Mehmandoust
