According to the SMS that I received from the company, I thought the deadline of this project is gonna be until Friday,
so I was doing my other jobs, and just checked the academy website and realized that I only have 1 day for this project.
I didn't have much time, but managed to do some stuff on this project as below:

app is connected to the api, pagination works fine.
animations and add user implemented, too.
new: single user details implemented: click on user to get info 

responsiveness is not bad, didn't have much time to work on that, too, but maybe I could manage to fix that later on future projects (?)

the part for posting new users is implemented, but the website reqres.in isn't really optimized, maybe you don't get what you want on the UI,
you can check the code though. (post request is implemented, no worries.)

also the search UI is implemented, but the api does not support a search api.

libraries being used:
NextJS, 
TailwindCSS, 
FramerMotion, 
Axios

developed using NextJS, clone and use `npm run dev`, 
or just visit `https://boomino.vercel.app/`, or `https://boomino-git-main-th-mhmn.vercel.app/`

for further implementations, check out the websites I've created and mentioned om my resume.


Thanks for your attention,
Taha Mehmandoust
